# LORA( Level of repair analysis and minimum cost homomorphisms of graphs) 

Research lead by Dr. Arash, about Homomorphism Problems in Digraphs. 
The present project aims to verify in detail each approach to distill the most elegant proof and most efficient algorithms to solve Homomorphism Problems in polynomial time.

The ideal of the project is to design an algorithm using Linear Programming to achieve a solution in polynomial time for LORA( Level of repair analysis and minimum cost homomorphisms of graphs)
